# DVLD-System

_A Desktop Application for a Vehicle Licensing Department, built using the 4-Layer Architecture, the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) design pattern, and **Dependency Injection (DI)** for enhanced modularity and testability._

This **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application is developed in **C# WinForms** using **ADO.NET** for database operations and integrates with a **Microsoft SQL Server** backend. 
The project is designed to be modular, maintainable, and scalable, with clear separation of concerns across layers.
