# DVLD-System

**DVLD-System** is a desktop application built for managing operations within a Vehicle Licensing Department. It is structured using a 4-Layer Architecture and follows the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) design pattern. The project makes use of Dependency Injection (DI) to promote modularity, testability, and maintainability.

## Technologies

- C# WinForms for the UI
- ADO.NET for database operations
- Microsoft SQL Server as the backend
- MVP pattern for separation of concerns in the presentation layer
- 4-Layer Architecture:
  - Presentation Layer (UI)
  - Business Logic Layer (BLL)
  - Data Access Layer (DAL)
  - Entities Layer
- Dependency Injection to decouple components

## Features

This is a CRUD-based application (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that supports:

- Managing vehicle records and licensing data
- Clean separation between layers for ease of testing and scaling
- A modular structure suitable for extension and future enhancements


## Current Status

This project is a WIP. Development is currently paused while I focus on learning some additional technical concepts that will help improve the design and implementation of the system. I'm looking forward to returning to it soon.
